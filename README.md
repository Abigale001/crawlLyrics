# crawlLyrics
This is a simple python crawler to get lyrics from netease-music. 
ONLY for CHINESE songs.

It's my first time to code a crawler. So if you have any questions, please contact me to learn together.


Steps:
1. get names of songs from playlists (playlists_id is from user)
2. delete the duplicated songs
3. get all lyrics and save in txt file

How to use:
1. change the file path to save in LINE 30
2. change the playlist ids in LINE 63,64 and 65
3. run it

What the txt file looks like:

 one line one song
